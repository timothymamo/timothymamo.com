Hi, I'm Tim. Originally from the small island of Malta, but am now living in the beautiful city of Haarlem in the Netherlands with my partner and 2 cats.

Over the years I've studied and got my Masters in Aerospace engineering (I also spent a few years as a cabin crew member with Air Malta), worked in the automotive industry, where I got to work with different companies on a variety of projects, and was also involved in the design of a Hybrid vehicle. I consider the years that I spent as an automotive engineer provided me with a very solid foundation in engineering, which helped me transition to the fast paced world of the Cloud. I now help companies build cloud native platforms with my work at [Container Solutions](https://www.container-solutions.com/).

During my free time I enjoy playing board games and tinkering with my home automation system. My main expenses in life are travelling and getting tattooed (so I've been saving a fair amount during Corona times ).

Feel free to message me ([email](mailto:tim@timothymamo.com)/[twitter](https://twitter.com/timothy_mamo)) should you wish to get in touch about anything I write on here, wether you agree with it or not :).
