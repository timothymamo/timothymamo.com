## Didn't Really Seize the Day

Well, I've made it. I'm a statistic, one of 95% of blogs that got abandoned (according to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/fashion/07blogs.html)). So I didn't quite [seize the day](/post/my-first-post). I could blame life getting in the way (started a new job with [Container Solutions](https://www.container-solutions.com/)), Corona (wait shouldn't that have made it easier as I'm stuck home more!!) or any other ridicules excuse. But in reality I just didn't put my head down and commit to it properly. So I'm going to set myself some targets, plan accordingly and not be one of the 95% anymore!!!

## Things to Come

Ok so now that I've set my targets, I'll put them out in the open. Like this I'm accountable to anyone who reads this blog, even if it might be just me ;). Here's a list of what I want to talk about and blog:
- Platform Layering
- D.I.E. Infrastructure
- GitOps
- Agile and Scrum (and why it should end)
- Observability
- Team Topologies and how every org should be doing this
- Structuring your IaC
- Buzzwords and Best Practices
- Blog Series on the Basics
- and more .....




## Not a Virgin anymore

So here I am, a not a virgin anymore
