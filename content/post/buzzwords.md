## TL;DR


## Introduction

The cloud has enabled startups to deploy their product to the world at very low starting costs. It has also enabled them to innovate at amazing speeds, facilitating growth, and continuously improving their product. All of this is vital for them to succeed. 

This usually starts with someone within the company, the most technical of one of the co-founders, creating an account with one of the big 3 (AWS, Azure, GCP). They click on some buttons, following a crash course of the cloud provider, and deploy infrastructure where they want to have their software for the world to consume.

As someone who has been designing, creating and maintaining multiple platforms on the cloud for a few years, you'd probably be surprised when I believe that this is exactly what startups should do. Forget about infra as code (whether its terraform, pulumi or the latest flavour of IaC), being Agile (what is that exactly?), having automated testing with canary deployments or any of that. Startups need to focus on getting their product out and ensuring that their grand idea is actually viable and there is someone who will actually use it and maybe pay for the service.
